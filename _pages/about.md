Yezhen Sun, male, originally from Quanzhou, Fujian, China. I completed my undergraduate studies at the College of Mechanical and Automotive Engineering, Fujian University of Technology, majoring in Mechanical Design, Manufacturing, and Automation. I was selected into the Intelligent Manufacturing Industry Engineer Experimental Class, where I focused on embedded systems, mechanical design, and manufacturing. During this period, I actively participated in academic competitions and won multiple national and provincial awards. Currently, I am pursuing a master’s degree in Mechanical Engineering at the same university, as a member of Professor Zou Cheng's team in the Internet of Things Laboratory. My research interests include UAVs, computer vision, LiDAR, and multi-sensor fusion technologies.
